### **$\textcolor{cyan}{\textsf{ Note, this will be a "major repo" containing EQGRP,Olympicgames,Brutalkangaroo,etc. }}$**

☢️ samples is not entirely mine, same with reports, I include samples and reports from many different sources, to make it easier to find "one in all repo". ☢️

- ***NOTE, it's not a entirely accurate repo-name, it's more than stuxnet and it's twins.***
- ENGRAMPA (the application) might be needed to un-pack with the password, because I used that to pack the samples.

 Stuxnet and it's family, twins, relations, etc. Like the Brutalkangaroo project(airgap), the DementiaWheel(wale?), Of course, the Olympic Games(StuxNet).
 And more. Guass, Duqu, Equation, and more samples.

 Why make this repo? I have always typed "I will provide my own samples for flame/duqu etc. etc." but never did that, cuz of some life problems, so but here it is! it will be slow though but My single goal with this repo is to make it..
 **easy. to. read.**
