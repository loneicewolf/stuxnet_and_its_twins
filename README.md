## Malware Samples

**NOTE:** Please see the [MAIN STUXNET REPO](https://github.com/loneicewolf/Stuxnet-Source) for tools, acknowledgments, resources, and additional samples.

- If you see `need PK compat. v5.1 (can do v4.6)`, you need to install `engrampa` on Linux. I use Qubes for malware and Engrampa to pack infected archives.
